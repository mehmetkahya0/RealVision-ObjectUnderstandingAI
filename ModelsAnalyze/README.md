# ModelsAnalyze - Model Performance Analysis Output

This folder contains all the analysis graphs, reports, and visualizations generated by the data science components of the Real-Time Object Understanding Application.

## Generated Files

### üìä Static Analysis Graphs
- **`model_performance_comparison.png`** - Comprehensive comparison of inference times, FPS, and detection counts across different AI models (YOLO, MobileNet-SSD, ONNX)
- **`detection_patterns_analysis.png`** - Analysis of object detection patterns, confidence distributions, and class frequency statistics

### üåê Interactive Dashboards  
- **`performance_dashboard.html`** - Interactive Plotly dashboard with real-time charts, model switching analysis, and performance trends

### üìÑ Performance Reports
- **`performance_report.json`** - Comprehensive JSON report containing detailed metrics, model comparisons, and statistical analysis

## How Files are Generated

### During Application Runtime
- Files are automatically generated when you press `A` during real-time detection
- Data is continuously logged and analyzed in the background
- Press `D` to toggle data logging on/off

### Manual Analysis
```bash
# Generate analysis from existing data
python analyze_performance.py

# Interactive analysis with dashboard
python analyze_performance.py --interactive

# Test the analysis system
python test_models_analyze.py
```
